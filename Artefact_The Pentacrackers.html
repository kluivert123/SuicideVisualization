        <h1>SUICIDE</h1>
        <section>
            <p> 
                Suicide, the act of intentionally bringing about one's own death, has become so prevalent in society today and should be addressed. Our team decided to x-ray some of the reasons 
                and details surrounding this menace. We started off by looking holistically at how the suicide rate was spread across geographical locations. Next, we tried to see the gender
                split with regards to suicide. It became clear that suicide was more common in men than women in all the years been considered (1985 to 2016). Considering suicide by age groups, the highest number
                of suicides were amongst 35-54 years olds, while the Russian Federation, United States and Japan topped the chart in almost each age group. In addition, the different methods used to commit 
                suicide was reviewed and firearm was found to be the most common method. A closer look at suicide by firearms showed that majority of suicides by this method occur in the United States. Lastly, it was 
                discovered that GDP per capita might not be directly linked to the suicide rates as there appeared to be no strong correlation between them.  Further studies should look at other possible factors that
                influence suicides as a proper understanding of the details and causes of suicide could be all that is needed to drastically drop the rate of suicide globally.
